// This file is intentionally blank as it's being deleted.
// If the operation is a deletion, the content can be empty or a comment indicating deletion.
// For Firebase Studio, if a file is marked for deletion, its content doesn't strictly matter
// as long as the operation type (if supported) indicates deletion.
// Since there's no explicit "delete" operation in the XML, 
// I am providing an empty content, assuming the build process will handle it or it will be manually deleted.
// Or, more simply, this <change> block for deletion might be omitted if the system doesn't process deletes this way.
// To be safe and explicit for the current XML format, I'm replacing with empty content.
